The feedback I received for the game was that it was difficult (although the person that said that conceded that it may just be the fault of their own skill) but that they enjoyed it and it was cute. Another person said that I should add music to it just to make it more interesting. Another person asked about making multiple levels and keeping track of the score even after refreshing the app. The feedback from the canvas app was that I was asked about the “practical uses” and they were a little let down when I said there were none. Another was impressed that I was even able to do it at all. And the last person said that rather than just dots, you should be able to switch between dots and dragging to make lines.
