I grew up in a military family, so other than my immediate family (my father, mother, and sister) I have nobody that was a constant presence in my life. And while I most certainly won’t deny the role my family had in my life and making me who I am today, I figured that was such a cliché answer that I didn’t want to give. Instead I’ve chosen a person that was important to me in the time that I new him. That person was my high school youth pastor, Matt Swider. When I had moved to Helena, Montana my sophomore year of high school I already knew I was at a disadvantage for making friends. Not only had I missed freshman year, or the “ice-breaker” year, but I also knew that in a city like Helena, most cliques would have been established long before high school and so finding a place to fit in would be more difficult. But then my sister and I decided to try a youth group to be a part of and ended up meeting Matt and the door where he greeted us with enthusiasm and interest. To someone that didn’t know where to find friends, that meant a lot. He obviously couldn’t spend the whole night with us (there were about 70 kids a night on average), but we did feel welcome to be there. So, we continued to go, and I continued to grow closer to Matt. Then I decided to join the student leader group for the next two years, and Matt became my mentor throughout that time. I learned a lot from him about being a good person and standing firm for yourself. He was also the one that baptized me, and I even have the honor of being one of his groomsmen at his wedding in December. He is a very important person to me that I feel very lucky to have met and learned from during high school.
