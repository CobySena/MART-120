        This image is one I made in photoshop in another one of my online classes: Digital Imaging (GDSN 149)<p></p>
        It's inspiration is based on two different stories from Greek mythology.<p></p>
        The first is the entity of Tartarus, which to the Greeks was both a place and a Primordial God. The place of Tartarus was thought to be the lowest part of the Underworld and the Prison of the Gods and hellish monsters. The being of Tartarus was thought to be one of the first Gods in existance, emerging from the Void of Chaos.<p></p>
        The second is the Phlegathon River. One of the 5 Rivers of the Underworld, it is a river of fire and is also known as the River of Healing, because it was used to keep tortured souls in the Fields of Punishment alive so that they could be tortured for eternity. It is the only river of the 5 that flows down into Tartarus.<p></p>
        There is an idea that the Phlegathon River is the very blood of Tartarus and that it flows directly to his heart, which was the inspiration for the image. Beyond looking cool and being based on Greek mythology, it really doesn't mean anything deeper than that.<p></p>
        Hope you like it.
